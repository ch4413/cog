## IBM Customer Churn Data

Using the dataset to assess the important features that management should consider in developing customer retention programme.

We focussed on two main questions:
* Can we accurately predict which customers will churn?
* Which factors heavily relate churn and can be used in a save strategy?

With sub questions of:
* How the model performs
* The financial savings from its implementation
